Project Description

It is the mission of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority to enhance the quality of life for women and their families in the U.S. and globally through community service. Our goal is to achieve greater progress in the areas of education, healthcare, and leadership development. Our members, affiliates, staff and community partners work to create and support initiatives that align with our vision. 
The goal of the web app/website is to 
* 1. provide a tool for effective communication among the chapters in the area 
* 2. communicate about events in the area in order to share resources and galvanize support 
* 3. educate other chapters on what we do. 
Essentially, this could be a preliminary trial for a Sorority-wide Social media app/site.
